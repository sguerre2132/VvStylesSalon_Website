      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Vv Styles Salon, your one-stop beauty shop in Greenwood, Indiana, where braids, nails, and brows come together under one creative roof.</p>

<p><strong>Although we opened our doors in January 2024,</strong> my journey began back in 2017, when I started braiding and building a name for myself, one client at a time. Over the years, my skills grew, my technique sharpened, and my clientele expanded to even NBA players. Braiding has always been more than just a hustle—it's my passion and my purpose.</p>

<p>At Vv Styles, we specialize in classic box braids, stitch braids, and custom looks crafted to suit your unique vibe. Healthy hair and clean parts are always the goal, and we take pride in blending skill with care.</p>

<p>But we’re not just about braids. Vv Styles is home to a small but powerful team of women. Alongside me are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A talented nail tech offering detailed, creative nail work</li>
  <li>A licensed wax and brow specialist focusing on brow shaping, lash lifts, and lamination for that flawless finish</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, we offer a full beauty experience in a warm, welcoming space where every client leaves feeling empowered and cared for.</p>

<p>As someone who’s been self-taught and hands-on for years, I now use my experience to teach others. My goal is to inspire up-and-coming braiders to master their craft, grow their confidence, and build a business of their own. Through hands-on classes, I share both techniques and knowledge about proper hair care—because protective styles should do more than look good; they should protect and preserve.</p>

<p>At Vv Styles Salon, we believe in empowering beauty, building confidence, and creating a space where everyone feels seen and styled.</p>
